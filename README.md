# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
Stock Market Price Prediction: Used machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistics Regression, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to identify which algorithm gives better results. Used Neural Networks such as Auto ARIMA, Prophet(Time-Series), and LSTM(Long Term-Short Memory) then compare make Inferences about the model.
